#  Rotate Image
## Description

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

## Example
Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]

## Constraints:

n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length

1 <= n <= 20

-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000

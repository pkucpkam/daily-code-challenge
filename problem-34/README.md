#  Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Example
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
Output: [1,2,4,5,6,7,3,8,9]

## Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

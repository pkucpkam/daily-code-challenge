# daily-code-challenge

**DailyCodeChallenge**! This is a personal project aimed at solving one or more programming problems every day.

## Target

- Enhance programming skills by tackling diverse problems.
- Explore various algorithms and data structures.
- Build a daily learning habit to foster self-improvement.

## How It Works

Each day, I will find and solve one or more new programming problems. These problems may come from various sources, including:

- Coding platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars.
- Problems from books or programming study materials.
- Self-created challenges based on learned concepts.

## Solutions 
Problems can be solved using different languages such as Python and Java, but Java will be the primary language.

# Longest Common Prefix
## Description

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

## Example
Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].
